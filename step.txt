1. Import the csv module to read and write CSV files.

2. Open the input CSV file using a with block, which automatically closes the file when the block is exited.

3. Create separate dictionaries to store the counts for male and female names.

4. Iterate through each row of the input file using a for loop and a DictReader object from the csv module.

5. Extract the name, gender, and count from each row and add the count to the appropriate dictionary based on gender.

6. Combine the male and female counts for each name into a single dictionary.

7. Sort the names by frequency in descending order using the sorted() function and a lambda function to sort by the second element of each tuple.

8. Open a new output CSV file using a with block.

9. Write a header row to the output file.

10. Iterate through each name in the sorted list and write its information to the output file, including the frequency, rank, and gender.

11. Handle ties by incrementing the rank only when the frequency changes.

12. Close the output file.
